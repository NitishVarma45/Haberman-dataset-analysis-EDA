In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), we examined four main variables: age, year of operation, number of positive axillary nodes, and survival status. Our goal was to understand the distribution and relationships between these variables to identify which features are most relevant for predicting survival outcomes.

Univariate Analysis:
Age:
The age of patients ranged from approximately 30 to 78 years. The distribution was smooth and showed no extreme outliers. The median age was around 52 years, and 75% of patients were below 60 years. Overall, age is a stable variable with no need for transformation.
Year of Operation:
Surgeries occurred between 1958 and 1969, with a mild right skew in the distribution. Most operations were clustered between 1962 and 1966. Again, no transformation was needed for the year variable.
Number of Nodes:
The number of positive axillary nodes was heavily right-skewed, with most patients having very few nodes (0 to 2) and a long tail up to 52 nodes. The median number of nodes was 1, and 75% of patients had fewer than 4 nodes. The presence of outliers and the strong skew suggest that this variable may benefit from transformation in modeling.
Survival Status:
The status variable was imbalanced, with about 73% survivors and 27% non-survivors.

Bivariate Analysis:
In our bivariate analysis, we explored relationships between these variables. Most pairwise relationships, such as age vs year or age vs nodes, showed little to no meaningful pattern. The strongest and most relevant relationship was between the number of positive nodes and survival status. Although some overlap existed, fewer nodes were associated with higher survival rates. Age and year were weaker predictors in comparison.

Final Conclusion:
In conclusion, the number of positive lymph nodes is the most significant feature for predicting survival outcomes in this dataset. While age and year provide some contextual information, they are comparatively weaker and do not show strong discriminatory power. The number of nodes shows the clearest relationship with survival status, making it the most informative variable among all features considered.
However, it is important to note that the node count is not a perfect predictor. Although lower node counts are generally associated with higher survival and higher node counts with poorer outcomes, there is still noticeable overlap between the two classes. This indicates that survival cannot be determined solely based on the number of positive nodes.
Overall, the number of positive lymph nodes serves as the strongest but not definitive predictor, and it provides the most meaningful insight for further analysis or modeling when combined with other variables.
