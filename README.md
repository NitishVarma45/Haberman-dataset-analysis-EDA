This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Haberman’s Survival dataset to understand the relationships between patient attributes and survival outcomes after breast cancer surgery.
The dataset contains the following features:
age – Age of the patient at the time of operation
year – Year of operation
nodes – Number of positive axillary lymph nodes
status – Survival status (1 = survived, 2 = not survived)
Objective:
The goal of this analysis is to understand:
The distribution of each variable
Relationships between variables
Which features are most informative for predicting survival
